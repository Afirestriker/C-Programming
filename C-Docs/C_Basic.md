# C/C++ Tokens
A token is the smallest element of a program that is meaningful to the compiler. Tokens can be classified as follows:
1.	Keywords
2.	Identifiers
3.	Constants
4.	Strings
5.	Special Symbols
6.	Operators

### Keyword: 
Keywords are pre-defined or reserved words in a programming language. Each keyword is meant to perform a specific function in a program. Since keywords are referred names for a compiler, they can’t be used as variable names because by doing so, we are trying to assign a new meaning to the keyword which is not allowed. You cannot redefine keywords.

### Identifiers: 
Identifiers are used as the general terminology for naming of variables, functions and arrays. These are user defined names consisting of arbitrarily long sequence of letters and digits with either a letter or the underscore(_) as a first character. Identifier names must differ in spelgitling and case from any keywords. You cannot use keywords as identifiers; they are reserved for special use. Once declared, you can use the identifier in later program statements to refer to the associated value. 

**There are certain rules that should be followed while naming c identifiers:**
• They must begin with a letter or underscore(_).
• They must consist of only letters, digits, or underscore. No other special character is allowed.
• It should not be a keyword.
• It must not contain white space.
• It should be up to 31 characters long as only first 31 characters are significant.
